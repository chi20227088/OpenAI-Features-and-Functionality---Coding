Creating The Dark Knight Trilogy, and the reason many DC fans say that DC movies are better than Marvel Films.\\n\\nBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016), played by Ben Affleck\\nR6tzxansdngnra5ee5izdeocva - from adam west to robert pattinson: this is how batman has changed over the years\\nAffleck is the only actor (so far) to not get his solo movie, and the possibilities of it happening are uncertain, maybe even impossible.\\n\\nNevertheless, his role is different from the other Batmans, with him being older and jaded because of all the deaths and destruction he has seen but being hopeful in humanity among the member of the Justice League.\\n\\nHe feels like Batman and Bruce are the same guys, and it really is a shame we couldn’t spend more time with him.\\n\\nGotham (2014-2019), played by David Mazouz\\nQf7qau37anf75nknc5wwobmnkm - from adam west to robert pattinson: this is how batman has changed over the years\\nWait, who? Well… yeah.\\n\\nThe show started following James Gordon in his early days at the Gotham City Police Department following the tragic deaths of Bruce’s parents and started telling the origin stories of some of the most infamous Batman villains.\\n\\nDuring the fourth season, Bruce Wayne starts to fight crime as a masked vigilante, and in the fifth (and final) season it shows Bruce becoming Batman for the first time.\\n\\n\\nWhile not the most popular version of Batman (I didn’t even know the show had Batman in it until doing research for this article), it promises to give a good origin story, and a side of the character we haven’t seen before.\\n\\nThe Batman (2022), played by Robert Pattinson\\nWu23mtvdhzbspep3rpmkrwm3fm - from adam west to robert pattinson: this is how batman has changed over the years\\nThis film, directed by Matt Reeves, is considered a reboot of the Batman film franchise (after the studio didn’t know what to do with Ben Affleck’s version).\\n\\nYou might find interesting: Robert Pattinson’s must watch films from ‘Twilight’ to ‘The Batman’\\n\\nIt tells the story of a young Batman, who has only been fighting crime for two years and is uncovering corruption while pursuing the Riddler, a serial killer who targets Gotham’s elite.\\n\\nPerhaps you have already seen it, or perhaps you’re like me and haven’t been able to find the time.', 0.9679346084594727)]\n",
